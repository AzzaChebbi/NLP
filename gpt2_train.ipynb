            "we present a novel deep recurrent network model recently proposed by deep convolutional neural network to learn disentangled representations . it turns out that there exist non canonical learning settings where the correspondence between an image and a code might be interpretable and not . in this paper we prove that a relaxation of sorts method can be enforced on the rclnn architecture to achieve desirable decomposability . the relaxation is based on constructing a test data set around a known code and then observing the results of that experiment based procedure . in an asymptotic sample size , we prove that rclnn achieves satisfactory reconstruction guarantees under various loss functions . in particular , when both the model and the algorithm are derived from constrained variational distributions , we show that the framework is fundamental for learning disentangled representations , while preserving the main message of the original data .\n",

            "the multi armed bandit setting is a useful abstraction for reinforcement learning involving close to NUMBER million actions recorded in training a set of n non trivial tasks . despite its enormous empirical success , the problems of exploration exploitation and control over behavior variability remain . in this paper , we introduce a reward function that supports exploration by combining squared output error and previous observations about the actions . specifically , we improve the result that the exploration objective is square relative to a prior distribution of the tasks where the exploration outcome is the expected log likelihood of the behavior . this distribution can be described naturally as a projected oracle . we focus on contexts in which prior knowledge is available either for steering the decision or explaining the behavior . our setting is one where the observations are collected as noisy observations over a temporal process some text processing . we consider experimental data from amazon product reviews , where an algorithm offers a reward for a label search , and a label proposal algorithm offers a reward for a sequence of searches . the rewards are typically modeled as a regression model over observations , but we show that this is possible if they are used to model the sequence of search outcomes . the exploration algorithm is especially interesting because it allows us to control the amount of observation weight associated with the correct label proposal , without having to model the rewards themselves . we further provide a proof of the equivalence between the exploration and the control settings in a noisy markov game . we demonstrate our algorithm on two cases neuroscience can learn behavior in an unbiased manner showing high rewards for control .\n",

            "an active learner is given a hypothesis class , a large set of unlabeled examples and the ability to interactively query labels that follow it and provide a base hypothesis for further exploration . the active learner is then given a hypothesis class , which contains only few labeled instances , but provides all labeled labels for an subset of these examples . at each iteration , the learner determines what label to use for the label of the next example . the goal is to learn as many labels as possible . while previous methods require that each instance be chosen relatively randomly in hindsight , this paper addresses this limitation by proposing a new active learning algorithm that dynamically selects instances with appropriate labels for the remaining instances . this allows the learner to experiment with different label choice and has potential applications such as natural language processing .\n",

            "we consider the problem of sparse regression with large entries , and propose a new algorithm , called sparse regression with large observations that combines sparsity and observation learning in a principled way . our algorithm is independent of operator splitting , and can be controlled using alder iterative optimization . we give theoretical guarantees on the performance of our algorithm over both the real and approximate instances . experimental results are presented , where our algorithm achieves the performance target of the standard svm algorithm without the lagrangian condition .\n",
            "in this work we consider a variant of the well known extension theorem that allows for a truly inexact oracle iteration . we argue that in such cases the only reasonable way to conduct an inexact iteration is to first cast the iteration as a svm procedure and then cast the solution back into a sequence of iterates following the exact solution . we propose a novel algorithm that utilizes a scheme whereby the first execution step yields a truly inexact optimality result , while the second step yields a slower iteration that does not yield a speedup . moreover , the second step does not yield a performance metric since it is not efficient to compute it . we empirically demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields similar solutions to the problem of approximate kl similarity between sparse linear combinations of vectors to which we refer to as the fully adversarial sparse coding procedure .\n",
            "stochastic convex optimization algorithms are the most popular way to train machine learning models on large scale data . scaling up the training process of large models is extremely challenging , due to the adversarial nature of the adversarial term . moreover , these stochastic updates can be expensive either way , either taking multiple batches of the model data or taking extreme care of estimating the covariance function . this paper proposes an end to end framework to tackle these problems efficiently while leveraging the complexity in the adversarial formulation . our framework assumes that we are given access to an automated distributed training procedure that is also set to the desired target distribution . we propose two distributed stochastic algorithms that are both fast and easy to implement . our algorithms are both found an . one algorithm is a single pass online algorithm that adapts to the multiple update sets received by the model while the other algorithm is one pass updates that are routed to an arm that can handle overlapping . we show that our algorithms outperform the state of the art on a large scale benchmark of multiple engine programming tasks , where we received over NUMBER\n"
